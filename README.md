Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using **Java**. This project provides two modes of gameplay: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer. It demonstrates core Java concepts like loops, arrays, functions, and user input handling.

Features:

- Two Game Modes:  
  - Player vs Player**: Two players can play the game by entering their moves.
  - Player vs Computer**: The player plays against the computer, which chooses moves randomly.
  
- Game Flow:  
  - Players take turns to enter their moves (row and column).  
  - The game continues until there's a winner or a draw.  
  - The computer makes its move randomly when it's the computer's turn.
  
- Win Condition:  
  The game checks for winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals. A player wins if they manage to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Requirements

- Java Version: JDK 8 or higher
- IDE/Tools: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)

Usage:

When you run the program, you will be prompted to choose between playing against the computer or playing with a friend.

- Play with Computer: The game will alternate between the player (X) and the computer (O).
- Play with Friend: Two players can take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
